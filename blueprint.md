## Blueprint

### Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating a Flutter application with a focus on a clean, well-structured, and maintainable codebase. The application will follow modern design principles and leverage a set of predefined tools and packages to ensure consistency and efficiency.

### Style, Design, and Features

The application will adhere to the following style and design guidelines:

- **Theme:** A consistent theme will be applied throughout the application, using a predefined color scheme and typography.
- **Components:** Reusable UI components will be created to ensure a consistent look and feel across all screens.
- **State Management:** The `provider` package will be used for state management, following the `ChangeNotifierProvider` pattern.
- **Routing:** The `go_router` package will be used for declarative routing, enabling a more organized and predictable navigation flow.
- **Code Quality:** The code will be formatted using `dart format` and will adhere to the linting rules defined in the `analysis_options.yaml` file.

The application will include the following features:

- **Authentication:** Users will be able to register and log in to the application.
- **Batch Creation:** Farmers will be able to create new batches of produce, providing details such as crop name, farm name, planting date, and harvest date.
- **QR Code Generation:** A unique QR code will be generated for each batch, allowing for easy tracking and identification.
- **Location Services:** The application will fetch the user's current location when creating a new batch, providing valuable information about the origin of the produce.

### Current Task: Fix Location Services

The current task is to fix the location services feature, which is currently failing due to missing permissions. The plan is to:

1. **Add `geolocator` and `geocoding` packages:** These packages will be used to handle location services in a more robust and reliable manner.
2. **Configure Android permissions:** The `AndroidManifest.xml` file will be updated to include the necessary location permissions.
3. **Configure iOS permissions:** The `Info.plist` file will be updated to include the necessary location permissions.
4. **Update `create_batch_screen.dart`:** The `_getLocation` method will be updated to use the `geolocator` package and to handle location permissions gracefully.

By following this plan, we will create a solid foundation for a high-quality Flutter application that is both functional and easy to maintain.
