# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This is a Flutter application that will be integrated with Firebase. It starts as a simple counter app and will be expanded with more features.

## Style, Design, and Features (Initial Version)

*   **Framework:** Flutter
*   **UI:** Material Design
*   **Theme:** Default `ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple)`
*   **Functionality:** A simple counter app that increments a number when a button is pressed.

## Current Plan: Firebase Integration

The goal is to integrate Firebase into this Flutter application.

**Steps:**

1.  **Configure IDE for Firebase:** Set up the Firebase Studio environment to work with Firebase services.
2.  **Add Firebase Dependencies:** Add the necessary Firebase packages to the `pubspec.yaml` file.
3.  **Initialize Firebase:** Initialize Firebase in the main application entry point (`lib/main.dart`).
4.  **Connect to Firebase Project:** Guide the user to connect the app to their Firebase project using the `flutterfire configure` command.
